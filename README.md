## Profanity-Check
A small python program to check files for profanity words.

The program takes as input the file name or initials given, searches for it in the _current directory_ and outputs a profanity alert
if the file contains curse words.  
The program connects to [PurgoMalum.com](www.purgomalum.com) website to check if a word is a bad word or not.
